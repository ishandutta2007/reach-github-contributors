      Hi&nbsp;[fullname],
        <div></div><br>
        <div>
          With growing community of InstaPy few of us felt the need of a similar automation tool for Facebook as well. Having discussed with Tim, I realised Tim's focus is primarily on InstaPy and he might not have bandwidth to look after a brand new automation tool, which is why I decided to create a fork of InstaPy and build a community around it for Facebook automation. Basic design of the repo will be same with modifications of few features. As of now the project being a recent fork may have some unnecessary code to be cleaned up going forward.

          Our goal is to have atleast 20% of overlapping community between them. Let us know if any of you prioritize Facebook automation and are keen to contribute to it and bring it at par with InstaPy, will add you as a member of the organisation.
